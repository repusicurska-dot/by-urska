    climbing:
      "Before I became an artist, I dedicated my life to climbing. As a professional competition climber, I had the honor of competing at the highest international level. Along the way, I became the European Champion in bouldering, overall National Champion in both bouldering and speed climbing, a European Cup medalist, a World Youth Vice Champion, European Youth Cup overall winner and earned a podium finish at the World Beach Games.",
    shaped:
      "Climbing shaped who I am. It taught me discipline, resilience, presence, and the courage to trust my instincts. Every route was a lesson in perseverance, every challenge an invitation to grow. But as meaningful as that journey was, it eventually led me toward a deeper search — one that could not be expressed through movement alone.",
    today: "Today, I express that journey through art.",
    work:
      "My work is a way of giving form to my soul. Every painting is a reflection of emotions, experiences, and moments that cannot always be put into words. Just as every climb tells a story, every artwork carries a part of my inner world.",
    dialogue:
      "For me, art is more than creating something beautiful. It is a dialogue between the soul, the heart, and the unseen. It is a space where intuition leads, where silence speaks, and where the invisible becomes visible through color, texture, and movement.",
