        <h2>1. Website operator and scope</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms &amp; Conditions govern the use of this website and the purchase of
          artworks from {business.legalName} ({business.legalForm}), {business.registeredAddress},
          {" "}{business.country} (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;). See our{" "}
          <a href="/legal/notice">Legal Notice</a> for full business details. These Terms apply to
          all visitors and to anyone who places an order through this website.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Artwork&rdquo; means an original painting or edition offered for sale on this
          site. &ldquo;Consumer&rdquo; means a natural person acting for purposes outside their
          trade, business, craft, or profession. &ldquo;Order&rdquo; means a request to purchase
          one or more Artworks submitted through the checkout flow.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>3. Artworks and their representation</h2>
        <p>
          Each Artwork is described with its medium, materials, dimensions, and, where
          applicable, edition information. Photography is provided in good faith but may not
          perfectly reproduce color, texture, or scale across every screen — see the artwork page
          for the disclaimer that applies to all product photography.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>4. Availability and pricing</h2>
        <p>
          Original artworks are one of a kind; availability can change without notice until an
          order is confirmed. All prices are shown in Euro (€). Prices marked as provisional are
          not final and must be confirmed before an order is placed. VAT/tax treatment is
          indicated per artwork and, where applicable, added at checkout.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>5. Orders and acceptance</h2>
        <p>
          Submitting an order through checkout is an offer to purchase, which we are free to
          accept or decline (for example if an artwork has just sold, or payment cannot be
          verified). A contract is formed only once we confirm acceptance of your order.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>6. Payment</h2>
        <p>
          Payment is processed through a third-party payment provider at checkout. We do not
          store full card details. Online payment is not yet live on this site — see the checkout
          flow for current status; until then, orders are arranged individually by inquiry.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>7. Shipping, international orders, and customs</h2>
        <p>
          See our <a href="/legal/shipping">Shipping &amp; Delivery</a> page for processing times,
          shipping zones, and packaging. For deliveries outside the EU, import duties, taxes, or
          customs charges may apply and are the responsibility of the recipient unless we state
          otherwise for a specific order.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>8. Delivery and risk</h2>
        <p>
          Risk in an artwork passes to the consumer on receipt of the goods, or on receipt by a
          carrier chosen by the consumer that we did not offer, consistent with applicable EU
          consumer protection rules.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>9. Withdrawal, cancellations, and returns</h2>
        <p>
          Where you are a consumer ordering from the EU, you may have a statutory right of
          withdrawal, subject to legally valid exceptions (for example genuinely custom-made or
          personalized artworks). Full detail is in our{" "}
          <a href="/legal/returns">Returns &amp; Cancellations Policy</a>. Nothing in these Terms
          removes a right that cannot legally be waived.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>10. Damaged or non-conforming goods</h2>
        <p>
          If an artwork arrives damaged or does not conform to its description, contact us with
          your order number and photographs as described in the Returns &amp; Cancellations
          Policy. Your statutory rights regarding non-conforming goods are not affected.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>11. Intellectual property</h2>
        <p>
          All artwork images, text, quotes, and site content are owned by us or Urška unless
          stated otherwise, and are protected by copyright. Purchasing a physical artwork
          transfers ownership of that physical object only — it does not transfer copyright or
          reproduction rights unless expressly agreed in writing.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>12. Website use</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to use this site lawfully and not to interfere with its operation or attempt
          to circumvent its security.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>13. Liability</h2>
        <p>
          Nothing in these Terms limits liability where such limitation is not permitted by
          applicable law (for example for death, personal injury caused by negligence, or fraud).
          Subject to that, our liability is limited to the extent permitted by applicable
          consumer protection law.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>14. Force majeure</h2>
        <p>
          We are not liable for delay or failure to perform caused by events beyond our
          reasonable control.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>15. Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Personal data is handled as described in our <a href="/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>16. Complaints</h2>
        <p>
          Contact us first at <ProtectedEmail /> to resolve any complaint. See our{" "}
          <a href="/legal/notice">Legal Notice</a> for applicable dispute resolution contacts.

      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>17. Governing law and jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of Slovenia, without prejudice to any mandatory
          consumer protection provisions of the country in which you, as a consumer, are
          habitually resident, which continue to apply where applicable law requires it.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>18. Changes to these Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms from time to time; the version in effect at the time of your
          order applies to that order.

        <h2 id="zvezdni-koledar">19. Star Business Calendar subscription (Zvezdni poslovni koledar)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>What it is:</strong> a personal digital astrological calendar and monthly horoscope, delivered on
            this website, by email and as a calendar feed. It is spiritual and entertainment content and is not
            financial, legal, medical or other professional advice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Price and renewal:</strong> €1 per month. The subscription renews automatically every month
            until you cancel. No VAT is charged (seller not registered for VAT).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Free trial:</strong> new subscribers get 7 days free, once per email address. If you cancel during
            the trial, you are not charged. Otherwise the first payment is taken when the trial ends.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cancellation:</strong> at any time, with the “Cancel subscription” button on your calendar page.
            Access continues until the end of the trial or the period already paid for; no further payments are
            taken. Payments for periods already started are not refunded, except where the law requires it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right of withdrawal:</strong> the service is digital content supplied immediately. By starting the
            subscription you expressly request that it begins straight away and acknowledge that you thereby lose the
            14-day right of withdrawal once supply has begun. The free trial and cancellation at any time apply
            regardless.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Your data:</strong> we store your email, birth date, optional birth time and birth time zone only to
            calculate your calendar and send it to you. Payments are processed by Stripe; we never see your card
            details.

        <h2 id="poetry">20. Letters from the studio subscription (Poezija Urške)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>What it is:</strong> a weekly letter by email — a poem or a short piece of writing by Urška, with
            one of her paintings beside it — plus an archive of past letters on this website. It is creative writing,
            not advice of any kind.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Price and renewal:</strong> €4.99 per month. The subscription renews automatically every month
            until you cancel. No VAT is charged (seller not registered for VAT).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Free trial:</strong> new subscribers get 7 days free, once per email address. If you cancel during
            the trial, you are not charged. Otherwise the first payment is taken when the trial ends.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Delivery:</strong> letters are sent on Thursdays, normally one per week. In some weeks there is no
            new letter; the subscription price is for continuing access to the letters and the archive, not for a
            guaranteed number of letters in a given month.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cancellation:</strong> at any time, with the “Cancel subscription” button on your letters page.
            Access continues until the end of the trial or the period already paid for; no further payments are
            taken. Payments for periods already started are not refunded, except where the law requires it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right of withdrawal:</strong> the service is digital content supplied immediately. By starting the
            subscription you expressly request that it begins straight away and acknowledge that you thereby lose the
            14-day right of withdrawal once supply has begun. The free trial and cancellation at any time apply
            regardless.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The letters remain Urška&rsquo;s work:</strong> they are for your own reading. Please do not
            republish or redistribute them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Your data:</strong> we store your email address and the language you chose, in the same account as
            the Star Business Calendar. Payments are processed by Stripe; we never see your card details.

        <h2 id="instant-reading">21. Instant tarot readings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>What it is:</strong> a tarot reading generated automatically on this website the moment you
            ask for it — cards drawn at random and interpreted from a fixed set of texts. It is not a personal reading
            by Urška (those are the live readings, booked separately). It is spiritual and entertainment content and is
            not medical, legal, financial or other professional advice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Price:</strong> one reading per week in each theme is free. Further readings cost €2 (one card) or €3 (three
            cards) each, paid once through Stripe; there is no subscription. No VAT is charged (seller not registered
            for VAT).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right of withdrawal:</strong> a paid reading is digital content supplied immediately. Before paying
            you expressly request immediate supply and acknowledge that you thereby lose the 14-day right of
            withdrawal. If a reading you paid for is not delivered, write to us and we will send it or refund you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Your data:</strong> for the weekly free reading we keep a record of your IP address for one week, to
            count it. For a paid reading Stripe collects your email address, and we use it only to send you a copy of
            the reading. Payments are processed by Stripe; we never see your card details.
